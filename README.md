## Data Storage

Bosh automatically saves your tasks to a data file (`data/bosh.txt`) after every change. There's no need to save manually!

### Data File Location

- The data file is created in a `data` folder in the same directory as the `bosh.jar` file
- If the data file is missing or corrupted, Bosh will start with an empty task list
- You can transfer your data by copying the entire `data` folder

### Backup Your Data

We recommend backing up the `data` folder regularly to prevent data loss.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: The application won't start**

A:
- Make sure you have Java 17 or higher installed
- Try running `java -version` in your command terminal to check

**Q: My tasks disappeared**

A:
- Check if the `data` folder and `bosh.txt` file exist in the same directory as the jar file
- If the data file is corrupted, Bosh will start with an empty list

**Q: I can't find a task I added**

A:
- Use the `list` command to see all tasks
- Use the `find` command to search for specific keywords

**Q: Date formats aren't working**

A:
- For precise date parsing, use the format `yyyy-MM-dd` (e.g., `2024-02-15`)
- For date with time, use `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` (e.g., `2024-02-15 1800`)
- Free text dates (like "Sunday") will be stored as-is

### Error Messages

Bosh provides helpful error messages when something goes wrong:

- `"A [task_type] needs a description"` - You forgot to add a description for your task
- `"There isn't a task #[number]"` - The task number doesn't exist, use `list` to check
- `"Missing /by"` - Deadline tasks need the `/by` keyword
- `"Event needs both /from and /to"` - Event tasks need both time markers
